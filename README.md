# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction with R

## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, where customers frequently switch providers due to pricing, service quality, contract terms, or better competitor offers. This project leverages machine learning models built in **R** to predict customer churn, helping telecom providers take proactive retention actions.

The system uses **three key datasets**:
1. `telecom_churn.csv`: Historical customer data used to train and evaluate the model.
2. `new_customers.csv`: A new, unlabeled dataset containing customer profiles for which churn risk is to be predicted.
3. `predicted_output.csv`: The output file generated by the model containing churn predictions for the new customers.

## 📊 Dataset Descriptions

### 📁 1. `telecom_churn.csv`
- **Purpose**: Used to train the predictive model.
- **Columns**:
  - Demographic info (e.g., `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `tenure`)
  - Service features (e.g., `InternetService`, `Contract`, `PaymentMethod`)
  - Billing info (e.g., `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`)
  - **Target**: `Churn` (values: `Yes` or `No`)

### 📁 2. `new_customers.csv`
- **Purpose**: Contains new customer data with the same structure as the training dataset but **without** the `Churn` column.
- **Goal**: Predict churn probabilities for these customers using the trained model.

### 📁 3. `predicted_output.csv`
- **Purpose**: Final output generated after applying the trained model to the `new_customers.csv` data.
- **Structure**: Includes all input columns from `new_customers.csv` with an additional column:
  - `Predicted_Churn`: (`Yes` or `No`), indicating whether the customer is at risk of churn.

## 🔍 Workflow

### 🔹 Step 1: Train the Model
- Load and preprocess `telecom_churn.csv`
- Handle missing values, factor conversion, encoding, and scaling as needed
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost)
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Save the best-performing model using `saveRDS()`

### 🔹 Step 2: Predict on New Customers
- Load `new_customers.csv`
- Apply the same preprocessing pipeline used for training
- Load the trained model using `readRDS()`
- Predict churn probability or class label
- Save results as `predicted_output.csv`

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

As churn prediction typically involves **imbalanced data**, we evaluate the model using:

- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

These metrics give better insight than simple accuracy, which can be misleading in imbalanced classification problems.

## 🧠 Sample Output

Example rows from `predicted_output.csv`:

| CustomerID | Contract        | MonthlyCharges | Tenure | Predicted_Churn |
|------------|------------------|----------------|--------|------------------|
| 001        | Month-to-month   | 70.30          | 2      | Yes              |
| 002        | One year         | 65.00          | 12     | No               |
| 003        | Month-to-month   | 95.40          | 1      | Yes              |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Build a web interface using **R Shiny** for real-time churn predictions
- Automate batch scoring for daily or weekly customer data
- Deploy the model using a REST API
- Integrate customer feedback for more dynamic prediction models
